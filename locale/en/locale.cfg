maraxsis=Welcome to [planet=maraxsis]. This planet is fully covered by water and there are no islands. Without a submarine, you will drown in two minutes. The three biomes are ocean plains, coral reef, and deepsea trench. Explore Maraxsis to craft the [item=hydraulic-science-pack].
maraxsis-trench-exploration=Occasionally while exploring Maraxsis you may find a deep gash in the planet's crust. This gash drops thousands of kilometers to an underwater trench. While above the trench, use __CONTROL__maraxsis-trench-submerge__ inside a [item=maraxsis-diesel-submarine] to decend. The deepsea trench is a dangerous place. It is completely dark and you will need [technology=maraxsis-torpedoes] to defend yourself.
