[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
maraxsis-briefing=[planet=maraxsis] is a fully submerged world with no islands on the entire surface. Without a [entity=maraxsis-diesel-submarine], you will drown in fifteen minutes. Most machines except for the [entity=chemical-plant] and [entity=maraxsis-hydro-plant] are not designed to handle extreme pressure and will only function inside a [entity=maraxsis-pressure-dome]. [fluid=maraxsis-saline-water] can be pumped by placing an [entity=offshore-pump] anywhere. The three biomes are ocean plains, coral reef, and deepsea trench. [fluid=lava] can be found in the trench however many other materials such [fluid=maraxsis-atmosphere], [item=carbon-fiber], and [item=tungsten-plate] must be shipped in from other planets. [entity=rocket-silo] cannot launch rockets without first researching [technology=maraxsis-project-seadragon].
maraxsis-trench-exploration=Occasionally while exploring Maraxsis you may find a deep gash in the planet's crust. The trench entrance is the lowest point on the surface of [planet=maraxsis] and it can be reliability located by travelling perpendicular to the [entity=cliff-maraxsis] contours. This gash drops thousands of kilometers to an underwater trench. While above the [tile=maraxsis-trench-entrance], use __CONTROL__maraxsis-trench-submerge__ inside a [item=maraxsis-diesel-submarine] to decend. The deepsea trench is completely dark, [item=night-vision-equipment] will not function. You will be crushed in thirty seconds without the protection of a [item=maraxsis-diesel-submarine] or a [item=maraxsis-nuclear-submarine]. The [entity=maraxsis-hydro-plant] gains four additional module slots in the trench. [fluid=lava] can be harvested from geothermal vents in the trench and processed into [fluid=molten-iron], [fluid=molten-copper], and [item=sulfur].
