[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
maraxsis=Welcome to [planet=maraxsis]. This planet is fully covered by water and there are no islands. Without a submarine, you will drown in two minutes. The three biomes are ocean plains, coral reef, and deepsea trench. Explore Maraxsis to craft the [item=hydraulic-science-pack].
maraxsis-trench-exploration=Occasionally while exploring Maraxsis you may find a deep gash in the planet's crust. This gash drops thousands of kilometers to an underwater trench. While above the trench, use __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ inside a [item=maraxsis-diesel-submarine] to decend. The deepsea trench is a dangerous place. It is completely dark and you will need [technology=maraxsis-torpedoes] to defend yourself. You will be crushed instantly without the protection of a [item=maraxsis-diesel-submarine] or a [item=maraxsis-nuclear-submarine]. Traveling two meters inside a trench corresponds to travelling only one meter on the surface.
