### Welcome to Maraxsis

Let me introduce this pristine, submerged world. Far away from the sun, this planet paradoxically maintains a comfortable temperature through a runaway greenhouse effect. 

Preliminary surface scans show an average temperature of 101°F. It's not too hot and not too cold, the perfect Goldilocks zone for liquid water.

Maraxsis is 100% covered by deep ocean. There is no land on the entire planet meaning you'll have to invest in aquatic technologies such as submarines, hydro plants, and submerged pressure domes. In terms of progression, Maraxsis is unlocked at the same point as Aquilo. This means the mod can be seamlessly added to a finished Space Age save.

Maraxsis is designed to take approximately fifteen hours to complete. There is also huge megabasing potential for those who would rather stay for longer.

Stuck? Check out one of the guides.

### Submarines

Your armor is designed to protect against attacks from various creatures, but it's totally useless against the immense pressure of the ocean. Your only hope is to build an underwater pressure can; the submarine.

This deep sea vessel is capable of submerging to any depth, and can be automated with a schedule to follow underwater channels.

Be careful, swimming outside the submarine will quickly result in death by extreme pressure, drowning, or both.

### Trenches

Occasionally while exploring Maraxsis, you might find a deep gash in the planet's crust. I wonder where this goes?

Your submarine descends for what feels like hours. Light levels slowly drop until everything is surrounded by a deep blackness. Your submarine begins to make horrible wrenching sounds as the hull integrity is pushed to its maximum. Finally you crash into the seabed. Is this finally the bottom?

While exploring the trench, you come across a geothermal vent. The magma appears to have similar composition as that found on Vulcanus. Perhaps it can be processed into basic metals?

### Pressure domes

As you explore Maraxsis, you’ll quickly discover that many of your standard machines are ineffective underwater. You are able to research new designs that function underwater however many recipes are still impossible. In these situations, constructing high-pressure domes becomes essential.

These specialized structures are designed to withstand the immense pressures of Maraxsis’ depths. However, maintaining equilibrium inside the domes requires continuous supply of atmospheric gases into ballast pumps.

Domes can be connected to the circuit network to change their color and read their contents. Feel free to create a giant underwater disco ball.

### Progression

Maraxsis is available at the same time as Aquilo. The mod does not change any vanilla recipes meaning the mod can be seamlessly added to any existing Space Age save, even if the save is completed. 

The mod leans heavily into the puzzle genre requiring creative setups to solve difficult challenges. Do you have what it takes to craft the hydraulic science pack?

There is also the [Maraxsis Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/maraxsis-start) mod to invert the tech tree and spawn you on Maraxsis.

Here's a sample of some of the technologies available on Maraxsis:

### Etymology

The name "Maraxsis" draws inspiration from Frank Herbert's Arrakis. The two worlds can be considered "equal but opposite". Both lack essential resources; land on Maraxsis, water on Arrakis; making survival difficult.

This connection is mirrored in their names. The shared suffixes “-kis” or “-sis” evoke a harsh, guttural sound, hinting at the hostility in these landscapes.

  - Arid → Arrakis
  - Marine → Maraxsis
